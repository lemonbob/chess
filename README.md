* Demonstration of code reuse to show how a drastically different result can come from writing modular code *

If you saw the "cyborg arena" game I posted a few weeks ago, this is a small experiment to test the reusability of the modules to create a very different game and a time-honoured classic — Chess! It demonstrates the benefits of efficient modular design in coding — seemingly dissimilar results can be based on the same core architecture with thoughtful code design.
