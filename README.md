# Demonstration of code reuse to show how a drastically different result can come from writing modular code

This code reuses the "cyborg arena" modules in my OpenClassrooms repository (Project 6). This small experiment is to test the reusability of the modules to create a very different game and a time-honoured classic — Chess! It demonstrates the benefits of efficient modular design in coding — seemingly dissimilar results can be based on the same core architecture with thoughtful code design.
