# Demonstration of code reuse to show how a drastically different result can come from writing modular code

This program reuses the "cyborg arena" modules in my OpenClassrooms repository (Project 6). This small experiment is to test the reusability of the modules to create a very different game and a time-honoured classic — Chess! It demonstrates the benefits of efficient modular design in coding — seemingly dissimilar results can be based on the same core architecture with thoughtful code design.

All the rules of chess are included in the game, including "en passant", Castling, and the calculation of draws and checkmate.

AI coming soon ... will you be able to beat Javascript Chess???
